Submit a copyright takedown notice

If your copyright-protected work was posted on YouTube without authorization, you may submit a copyright infringement notification. Be sure to consider whether fair use, fair dealing, or a similar exception to copyright applies before you submit. These requests should be sent by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

The fastest and simplest way to submit a copyright takedown notice is through our webform. We recommend using a computer for the easiest method.

Submit a copyright complaint

 

The name you enter as copyright owner will be published on YouTube in place of the turned off content. If you can give us a valid legal alternative, such as a company name or the name of an authorized representative, we'll review and apply it if appropriate. The name will become part of the public record of your request, along with your description of the work(s) allegedly infringed. All other information, including your full legal name and email, are part of the full takedown notice, which may be given to the uploader.

If you choose to submit a copyright takedown request, remember that you're starting a legal process.

Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

For managing numerous copyrighted pieces of content, you can use this form to see which copyright management tools are the most useful to you. We will also accept free-form copyright infringement notifications, submitted by email, fax, and mail. Learn how to report allegedly infringing non-video content on YouTube.
